//using backtrick
This code uses template literals (enclosed in backticks ``) to create a string containing HTML markup for each task. Let's explain each part:

<td>: This is an HTML table cell, representing the first column of the table where the task details are displayed.

<div class="form-check">: This is a div element with the class "form-check." It is used for styling and grouping the checkbox and label elements.

<input type="checkbox" class="form-check-input complete-task" ${task.completed ? 'checked' : ''}>: This is an HTML input element of type "checkbox" with the class "form-check-input." It represents the checkbox used to mark a task as complete or incomplete. The checked attribute is conditionally set based on the task.completed property. If the task is completed (task.completed is true), the checkbox will be checked; otherwise, it will be unchecked.

<label class="form-check-label ${task.completed ? 'completed' : ''}">${task.text}</label>: This is an HTML label element with the class "form-check-label." It displays the text of the task (task.text). The class "completed" is conditionally added to the label if the task is completed (task.completed is true). This class can be used for styling completed tasks differently.

<td class="actions">: This is another HTML table cell, representing the second column of the table where action buttons (Edit, Priority, Remove) are located.

Buttons:

<button class="btn btn-sm btn-info edit-button" data-index="${index}"><i class="fas fa-edit"></i> Edit</button>: This is the Edit button. It has the class "edit-button" and includes an icon (pencil) for editing. The data-index attribute is set to the current index value, which helps identify the task associated with this button.

<button class="btn btn-sm ${task.priority ? 'btn-warning' : 'btn-secondary'} priority-button" data-index="${index}"><i class="fas fa-star"></i> Priority</button>: This is the Priority button. Its class is conditionally set based on the task.priority property. If the task has high priority (task.priority is true), it will have the "btn-warning" class (yellow); otherwise, it will have the "btn-secondary" class (gray). The data-index attribute is set to the current index value.

<button class="btn btn-sm btn-danger remove-button" data-index="${index}"><i class="fas fa-trash"></i> Remove</button>: This is the Remove button. It has the class "remove-button" and includes an icon (trash can) for removal. The data-index attribute is set to the current index value.
